The TestSuite is composed of TestCases.
The TestSuite gathers the result of The TestCases in it and show it in some manner.
The TestCase must run methods the name of which starts with "test" in incasesensitive manner.

The TestCase must not run standalone, only the TestSuite can run the TestCase.
The TestCase must hold the result by itself,but can not show it.
What the result should look like must depend on the implementation of TestSuite's method "report".
